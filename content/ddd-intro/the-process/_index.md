# The process

The modelling process is composed of 8 steps which are introduced below.

A good talk that gives an overview of the process in the context of typical phases of designing sociotechnical architectures is ["Sociotechnical Architecture: co-designing technical & organizational architecture to maximize impact"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekMPm78KFj0&feature=youtu.be&t=1820) by [Eduardo da Silva](@emgsilva). Eduardo groups the activities of the process and its 8 steps in [four distinct phases](https://speakerdeck.com/emgsilva/intro-to-sociotechnical-architecture-co-designing-technical-and-organizational-architecture-to-maximize-impact?slide=31), namely:

1. Align & Understand
2. Strategic Architecture
3. Strategy & Org Design
4. Tactical Architecture.
