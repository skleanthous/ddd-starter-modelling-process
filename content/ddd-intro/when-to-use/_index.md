## When to use the DDD Starter Modelling Process?

If you're new to DDD or just not sure where to start, this process can reduce your cognitive load. It will guide you through following scenarios, and possibly others:

### Kicking Off a Greenfield Project

At the start of a new project the number of things you need to think about can be overwhelming. One or two iterations of this process can help you put the foundations in place.

### Beginning a Brownfield Migration

Before getting to work on modernising your legacy system, a few iterations of this process can help you to uncover essential information needed to create a vision for your target architecture.

### Kicking Off a Major Program of Work

When starting a new initiative involves a significant investment across many teams, it is essential to cover the 8 steps in the process. This process can guide you through the first few iterations.

### Explore Your Domain for New Learning Opportunities

Software development is a learning process. You can apply the DDD Starter Modelling Process at any time to uncover new insights, identify new opportunities, or simply share knowledge around the team.

### Assess Current State of Your Project

This process can be the foundation for assessing how well your current system is aligned to the domain and business model. 

### Re-organising Teams

A loosely-coupled architecture enables teams to work in parallel without being blocked. A loosely-coupled architecture also must be aligned to coupling in the domain. This process will help you to design a software architecture, and a team structure aligned with your domain.

### Practicing or Learning DDD

This process is ideal when you are new to DDD and want to practice, or you want to teach others the different aspects of modelling a domain. It's important to communicate that this linear process is not a realistic process. It's just a starting point to reduce cognitive load until you are confident with DDD.

## How to Adapt the Process?

This process can be customised in many ways. On a real project, you'll be switching between all 8 steps based on the new insights you gain or need to gain.

Below are a few reasons for deciding when to change the order or switch between steps.

### Start with Collaborative Modelling

If you want to get our whole team collaborating immediately, modelling the domain which they are familiar with might be more comfortable than talking about business models and strategy which they are less comfortable with.

### Start by Assessing IT Landscape

Before looking forward to the business vision and going deep into the domain, it might be better to visualise the existing architecture first. Start with step 5 and map out your strategic portfolio to see what the major constraints you will face are.

### Code Before Confirming Architecture and Team Boundaries

On some projects it makes sense to start by writing code sooner. Perhaps you need to deliver an MVP or the domain is so complex that creating a model in code is necessary before you can consider the architecture.

### Repeat Steps 2 (Discover) - 6 (Organise) Before Moving to 7 (Define)

Before you dive into the definition of individual bounded contexts, it may be beneficial to model the domain multiple times and look for different ways to decompose your system into sub-domains and teams.

### Organise Teams Before Designing Contexts

For a great deal of projects there are organisational constraints that we need to take into account. If this is the case, you should consider identifying possible team structures before designing architectures that you will never be able to implement.

### Blending Definition and Coding

Steps 7 (Define) and 8 (Code) can occur concurrently. This may happen when you are coding a bounded context, and the insights you get from writing code make you change the high-level design.
